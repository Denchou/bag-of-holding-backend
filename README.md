# What does our app do?
For our first group project at WDI, we were tasked to recreate Dropbox. In three days.

Our application allows users to store any file type remotely, modify how its recorded, delete it and allow other users to see and access it. We used free web hosting to build the application, so there
are some restrictions on the file size.
