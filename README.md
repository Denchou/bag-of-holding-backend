# What does our app do?
For our first group project at WDI, we were tasked to recreate Dropbox. In three days.

Our application allows users to store any type of file on our server remotely, modify how its recorded, delete it and allow other users to see and access it. We used free web hosting to build the application, so there are some restrictions on the file size.
